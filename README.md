 ## AtliQ Grands

 ### Scenario

 AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
 Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its 
 market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands 
 wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an 
 in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from 
their historical data.

### Recommendations 

* ADR for the rooms ,can be changed to dynamic so that we can have maximum revenue generations.
* Even the Weekend and Weekday Price we can change the pricing, that is for friday and saturday
  we can increase the pricing charged per room.
* Occupancy and ratings of four hotels are below 50 and 3 respectively.There Service need to be checked and
  need to find why they are performing less.
* There offline channels can provide free additional discounts or complimentary night stayetc.
* One of the hotels in delhi is performing really great compared to others in Delhi.So we can do an analysis
  as to what is making it more popular,so that we can implement it on the other hotels as well.
*  Ratings should be considered as one the main factors since nowadays no one does anything without looking at them.
